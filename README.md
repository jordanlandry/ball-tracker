# Ball tracker (Name TBD)

## Description

(Not all of these features have been implemented yet)

This project is a React Native Expo application that utilizes device camera capabilities to capture videos of moving objects such as golf balls,
baseballs, soccer balls, etc. It calculates and displays various metrics, including speed, distance, and time in the air. The app serves practical
purposes like measuring pitching speed, kicking distance, and golf ball analysis for distance and maximum height. Additionally, it offers advanced
features such as user management, data comparison, and performance tracking over time.

## Ideas

In addition to the above features, there are plans to conduct an extensive number of test runs, recording true results for various scenarios. These
recorded results will be compared to the calculated metrics obtained by the application. By analyzing the disparities between the actual and
calculated results, valuable data will be collected. This data will then be utilized to train a machine learning AI model. The objective is to develop
an AI that can effectively compensate for inaccuracies and biases introduced by factors such as camera limitations and frame rate variances. Multiple
test runs will be performed using different frame rates to observe the impact on accuracy, enabling the AI to adapt and adjust its compensation
weights accordingly. This machine learning approach aims to enhance the application's precision and provide more reliable metrics for users.

Another innovative approach to improve accuracy and realism is to leverage the speed change over multiple frames. By analyzing the velocity
differences between consecutive frames, such as frames 1-2 indicating a speed of 5 m/s and frames 2-3 indicating a speed of 4.5 m/s, it becomes
possible to estimate the impact of wind resistance on the moving object. Incorporating these velocity differentials into the calculation allows for a
more precise determination of the distance traveled by accounting for factors like wind resistance. This enhancement further enhances the accuracy and
realism of the distance calculation, providing users with more reliable results that consider real-world dynamics.

To further refine the wind resistance calculations, the application can leverage the user's location and access a weather API to retrieve local
weather data, specifically the speed of the wind in the area. By integrating this real-time wind speed information into the calculations, the app can
more accurately incorporate the impact of wind resistance on the moving object. With this additional data, users can obtain calculations that simulate
the theoretical maximum values without the influence of wind. This feature allows users to evaluate their performance under ideal conditions,
providing valuable insights and enabling them to set goals and track progress in various wind conditions. By incorporating real-time weather data, the
application enhances its functionality and provides users with a comprehensive analysis of their performance.
